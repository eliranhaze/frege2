To run this in development:

- change to 'DEBUG = True' in settings.py
- enabled = False in auth_ldap (to disable tau authenticaion)
- python manage.py runserver to run in dev

if static files don't show:
- needs to collectstatic first so run deploy (build not needed, I am not minifying my files)
- ln -s admin mgr in actual django folder, and inside in js

other requirements:
- pip install python-ldap (the ldap auth module)
- django version is 1.9.6
