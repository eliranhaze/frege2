- move to apache server
- (after moving to apache) see why icons dont show when using localtunnel
- fonts not working in mobile
- with localtunnel, when down error says server error instead of connection error (not good!)
- big tables not looking good on mobile, also when window has small width
- user answers should always be created, i.e. not override previous ones 
- there is the 'no overriding previous answer' in the requirements, think what to do following dana's answer (if only next year students is the issue, then delete old answers on login).
- change login to i.d number, with first time detection, no signup
