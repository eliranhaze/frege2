the 132.66.102.99 server is the right one, it is host.logic.tau.ac.il
(logic.tau.ac.il gives a different ip, probably a virtual machine running on top though)

to vpn i can logic with eliranhaze - a new user. pwd is Fn..!

also login via ssh with eliranhaze - a user on host.logic, pwd is in mail, then sudo -i to switch to root
